## Project Title - EDA on Iowa Housing Dataset using Python 

<dl>
  <dt>Project Overview</dt>
  <dd>This project aims to predict housing prices in Iowa based on various features such as OverallQuality, YearBuilt, BsmntFullBath. The dataset is available on Kaggle, which contains information on housing prices, demographics, and location attributes of Iowa.  Consists sample size of 1460 and 79 exploratory variables.</dd>

  - Data Analysis  </br>
<br />
The data was cleaned and pre-processed to handle missing values and outliers. Univariate,  Bivariate and Multivariate analysis for categorical and numerical variables. For testing 5 hypothesis, checking the correlation, used heatmap
</dd>

  <dt>Visualizations</dt>
  <dd> Several interactive visualizations were created to explore the data and convey the results of the analysis, including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots. Appropriate vizualization through bar plots, pairplots </dd>

  <dt>Challenges and Limitations</dt>
  <dd>One of the main challenges faced during the project was the large number of variables in dataset, selection of the independent variables for setting hypothesis was time consuming. Feature selection most difficult aspect.</dd>

  <dt>Conclusion</dt>
  <dd>Overall quality, living area and garage area are the strongest predictors of housing price. A larger living area tends to correlate with a higher sale price, while houses with better quality also generally have higher prices. On the other hand, the impact of year the house was built, and FullBath on housing prices is comparatively weaker.
